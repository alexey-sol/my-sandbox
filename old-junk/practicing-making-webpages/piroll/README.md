# Practicing making webpages
The demo of the work is [here](https://letscerebrate.github.io/my-sandbox/practicing-making-webpages/piroll/dist/). It's made according to [Piroll free PSD template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14uwTcZKo4z8wJS8Bt8IkMtwKYPt4Z_yV), by means of Pug and Sass. The source code is contained in `src` directory. `dist` contains compiled files: they're for the demo.

There're 5 pages in total. To get to `one-page.html`, please click on the logo in the navigation bar. `project-single.html` is available via the home page: just click on any item in the portfolio section.
