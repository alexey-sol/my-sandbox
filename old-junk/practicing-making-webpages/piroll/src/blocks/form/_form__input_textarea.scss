.form__input_textarea {
  height: 170px;
  resize: none;
}
// I understand that textarea element isn't some sort of a descendant/subset
// of input element, but since in this project, the only difference in styling
// these elements is that textarea has a couple more CSS properties, I've 
// decided to design this rule as a modifier for input.
